# Flask Market - A Tutorial Project

This repository contains my implementation of the "Flask Market" project, built by following the freeCodeCamp "Learn Flask for Python" tutorial. This project served as a hands-on exercise to understand the fundamentals of building a full-stack web application with Python.

The original tutorial can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qr4QMBUPxWo ). All credit for the project concept goes to the original creator.

## What I Learned

This was a comprehensive project that allowed me to gain practical experience with a wide range of web development concepts. Key skills I solidified include:

*   **Flask Fundamentals:** Structuring a web application, handling routes, and managing the request-response cycle.
*   **Database Integration:** Using **SQLAlchemy** as an ORM to define models, create relationships between database tables (Users and Items), and query data.
*   **User Authentication:** Implementing a complete and secure user authentication system from scratch, including registration, login/logout, and session management with **Flask-Login**.
*   **Web Security:** Hashing user passwords with **Flask-Bcrypt** to ensure they are never stored in plain text.
*   **Form Handling:** Creating and validating web forms using **Flask-WTF** to handle user input securely.
*   **Dynamic Templating:** Using the **Jinja2** templating engine to pass data from the Python backend to the frontend and create reusable UI components.

This project was a crucial step in bridging the gap between basic Python scripting and building real-world, database-driven applications.
